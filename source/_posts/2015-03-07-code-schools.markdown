description: Code schools polularize a new kind of skills by following techonoligical trend. People should realize that learning such skills requires the same amount of efforts applies to any other professional fields.

The forseeable future of our technological advanced society is that all mundane jobs will be gradually replaced by machines. As the level of manchine intelligience increases, the number of replacable jobs will also increase. So the direct consequence of this trend is that, people working with low level of skills such as cashier or cleaner or taxi driver will be forced out of jobs or they have to compete with machines for both productivity and cost efficiencies. 

Sam Altman has the best illustration in his post [The Software Revolution](http://blog.samaltman.com/the-software-revolution). 

_Let's not talk about self learning intelligence here._

To combat this unavoidable social economic situation, people need to be equipped with knowlege that is more advanced than machines. The real advantage of human beings is their creativity. Our past technological revolutions are all based on human inventions. It greatly changes our lives. We also create machines. However, they are constrained by the creators' settings and assumptions. If we know how to exploit those settings and assumptions, we can operate machiens more efficiently. Hence
we could secure our jobs as machine master. 

Simply put, we need to know how to program the machines.

Here comes the the topic of the post, code schools. Many governments are pushing to have more programming educations in secondary and primary schools. Students are encouraged to pick up programming courses as early as possible. The government is smart enough to act early to prevent future job crisis. For existing work force, people have the choice to admit to a vacational coding school. There are many such schools available. Most of them start by teaching simple web programming or mobile
programming in a 10~ weeks course. This is very good start because it lets people know, when they have acquired those skills, they are able to find a really good job. 

Nevertheless, learning a new skill should not be taken easy. Gladwell said in his book __Outliner: The Story of Success__
> The key to success in any field is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing a specific task for a total of around 10,000 hours

Practice is one thing. In order to understand the foundamental principle governing the machines, we need to take some CS courses as well. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science) is a pretty cool site packed with easy to learn materials. 

I always think learning is a life time business. It is also an accumulating process. Even though I know a little bit of coding stuff and able to program the computer to do something useful in large scale. I still feel the urge to learn. And learning should always be carried out at higher level, which means it should focus on the foundamental part of things shared by many. Mastered at higher level allows us to easily appreciate new things. Just like the physical principles behind universe
has no difference from those behind our daily lives. 

In any sense, I think code schools are a good thing. 

In Sam's article, software revolution is described as a big crisis. There two problems he sees 1. job destruction, 2. concentration of power. 

Obviously, improving peoples job skills is one of the solution for the first problem. Code school is part of the solution. 

He proposed a solution for the second problem: 

>...the best strategy is to try to legislate sensible safeguards but work very hard to make sure the edge we get from technology on the good side is stronger than the edge that bad actors get.  If we can synthesize new diseases, maybe we can synthesize vaccines.  If we can make a bad AI, maybe we can make a good AI that stops the bad one.

I entirely agree with him. I believe having more code schools creates such awareness in the society so that, people get to know the implications of technology in a deeper sense. Only after it becomes a problem for the public can it have enough traction to push for the legislation.
