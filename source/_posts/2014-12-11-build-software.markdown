Recent news even features US president Obama [writing code](http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/08/barack-obama-becomes-the-first-president-to-write-code/). 

So people are serious about learning coding now. This leads to some concerns among programmers about the tougher competition in the future. I never think it's a threat though. Learning a programming language isn't so hard in fact. You won't need more than 10 days in order to build a to-do list application. What distinguish professional programmers from amatur programmers is the set of skills to build softwares. 

Knowing how to code only solve problem in small scale. When it comes building large software, a discipline of knowledge is required. It's called software engineering. Software engineering is all about managing software complexity. Managing complexity can be interpreted in terms of the following problems:

1. How to write code that any new team member can quickly understand
2. 



These are all about the essential skills of a software engineer. Mastering those skills requires many years of practices. However building a great software requires more than knowledge and experiences.
It's the fusion of great craftmanship and talent of art. 

In the book of Pragmatic Programmer, it suggests the following principles:
