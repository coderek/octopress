The word `programmer` is just a generic term describing people who write code for computer to execute. Anyone who has a computer can just open a text editor and start writing code and they can call themselves `programmer`. But if you make a living by writing programs, you wouldn't want to call yourselve a `programmer` because you probably do more sophiscated things than just writing code.

Job title is actually important for people to understand what you do to make a living. If you are a lawyer, people will know you earn money by giving advice to people who do not understand laws well or defend client in the court for some commercial disputes.


My title in the company is `front end web developer`. It's a new and cool title in created in recent years for people building complex web applications using JavaScripts. I liked the title. However the public doesn't seem to understand it until Just like the title of the guy who found a job after attending a local coding school in the advetisement found in the subway train.

However, what I really want people call be is software engineer. It has a totally different meaning.



Being programmers, we always treat the ability to understand and write computer code as our unique living skill. This skill is always regarded as knowledge based, high tech profession with high barrier of entry. It earns us a decent living. If you happen to be a programmer in the Silicon valley, then your salary will easily go beyond 6-digit which is well above most working classes in the world. Obviously at this digital age, this new profession has become so popular that everyone realizes that besides being a doctor or lawyer, doing programming is also a pretty good career option.


Without any doubt, any industry will need the help of computer to increase their productivity and accomplish tasks they cannot do otherwise. This means the demand for computer programmer is going to keep increasing in the future. Politicians had forseen this trend hence they start to promote the programming education in order to reduce unemployment rate. [Barrack Obama has become the first US president to write code](http://techcrunch.com/2014/12/08/barack-obama-becomes-the-first-president-to-write-code/). Numerous coding schools had emerged in the public. People nowadays can easily access courses that teaches computer programming. To be a programmer no longer needs to be a computer enthusiast nor a university CS degree holder. As long as you are smart enough and know a little bit of programming, you will find a decent job in this field.

This is a great trend. I can imagine, in the near future, programming will be one of the curriculum in any primary school. We will have tons of smart people entering the industry in the future. The technological development will advance at faster pace as more research will be carried out. Human will eleviate to a higher level similar to that brought by the invention of computer. This all seems beautiful and nice.

Having talked so much, I haven't touched the topic I want to discuss today. What my discussion target is actually those coding schools.
