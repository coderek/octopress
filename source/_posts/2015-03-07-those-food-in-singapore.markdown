Singapore is famous for its food. There are plenty of reasons for that. As the hub of South East Asia, Singapore has a unique mixture of multi-culture. This is best manifested by its food. You can have a taste of literally every type of cuisine around the world. You also can enjoy some of their best local inventions. And unlike Toronto, those cuisines are so tasty and authentic. 

My fond memory of Singapore are mostly about food. 

#### Qiulian Banmian 秋莲板面 <span class='tag'>local</span>

In my first years in Singapore, this is my favourite food. It's simple to make, I think. Just put thick noodle, egg, minced meat ball and some vegetable together plus the dried baby fish to add some salty taste. It was so delicious. They also serve a special kind of chilli source. I usually pour 2 small dishes of those source to add a stronger taste. It cost only 3.5SGD at the time, which is considered cheap. 

#### Bakuteh 肉骨茶 <span class='tag'>local</span>

Singapore's Signature Dish. 

Tasty pork ribs with garlic soup. The original recipes I think includes more sophiscated herbal ingredients. Nowadays, the popular Bakutech shops uses a simpler vairent with mostly garlic and pepper. 

#### Hananese Chicken Rice 海南鸡饭 <span class='tag'>local</span>

This is not from Hainan China. It's created by early Hainan immigrants to Singapore. It's recipe is not as simple as it looks. The rice is cooked using Chicken broth. The chicken is chicken meat with skin is also tender enough. You also can order chicken tigh for SG$0.5 extra. The chilli is also specially made. You can't find the same chilli source for other dish.

#### Laska <span class='tag'>local</span>

Laksa is a famous Peranakan cuisine. Thus the best laksa I've had in Singapore is from Katong Laksa. It's near to the Joo Chiat Place where tons of Singapore heritage located. However, it's the laksa I had when I travelled to Penang, Malaysia that make me love this dish.  

#### Char kway teow 炒粿条

Penang has a lot of good street food. This is one of them. Singapore Char kway teow inherited Penang style quite well. There is a Malaysia restaurant in Toronto. I've had Char kway teow there before. The kway teow (noodle) is pretty tasty though they don't have cockle. Yes, cockles can be found in Laksa. It is cockles that make char kway teow distinguished. 

#### Nasi lemak 椰酱饭 <span class='tag'>local</span>

### End
The best thing about eating in Singapore is that these delicious foods are easily accessible. Most of the dishes presented above can be found in Hawker center which is Singapore's version of non-air-conditioned food court. Hawker center is the place that folks from all walks of life meets, chats and 'makans' (eat, in malay). It's the best place to understand Singaporean life.
